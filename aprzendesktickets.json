Please advise…  Thank you\n\n \n\n \n\nThis is a text from Daniel Alpher:\n\n \n\nYes-it's being temperamental when I unplug it and wait a minute & plug it back in it'll print a few pages... I was printing out an offer that I downloaded to my desktop and then printed it , but I was thinking maybe because the document was secured from DOCUSIGN as a PDF maybe that's why it only printed the first four pages-The agent emailed it to me from DOCUSIGN... i'll just take care of this tomorrow but thought I'd give you the update and let you know that the printer is not working properly-thank you\n\n \n\nPlease advise,\n\nDon\n\n \n\nDon Faught,CRS, G.R.I.\n\nVice President/Managing Broker\n\nALAIN PINEL REALTORS®\n\nOffice 925.251.1111\n\nCalBRE# 00971395\n\n2013 California Association of REALTORS® President\n\n2013 California REALTOR® of the Year\n\n2012 Bay East Association of REALTOR® of the Year\n\nNAR Hall of Fame\n\n \n\nSurround yourself with people that inspire you.\n\n \n\nThe experience is Alain Pinel REALTORS® visitapr.com (http://www.apr.com/)\n\nThis e-mail message, together with any attachments, is intended only for the use of the individual or entity to which it is addressed.
