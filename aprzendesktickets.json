member email communications. Our marketing department has looked into the issue and identified that your email provider has put a block on emails from us. At this time, we do not have a fix on our end to reestablish having the emails come through to you. Our recommendation is for you to update the email address on file to use a different domain. You can also reach out to your IT department, if this is a work email address, and see if they can do anything to unblock our communications.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to change the email address on file for your account, you can login to your online account manager at www.49ers.com/myaccount<http://www.49ers.com/myaccount> to edit or reply to this email with the updated address to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is anything else we can do for you at this time.\r\n\r\nBRANDON LOHMANN\r\nManager, Premium Services\r\nForty Niners Stadium Management Company\r\nT 408.579.4442<tel:408.579.4442>  |  M 408.731.0095<tel:408.731.0095>\r\nLevi's® Stadium\r\n4900 Marie P.

Let us know if you agree to them to continue using Instagram.\n\nUpdates to Our Terms and Data Policy\n\nYour Instagram experience isn't changing, and you still own your photos and videos. We are giving you better ways to access your data and understand how it's used.\n\nInstagram has been a part of Facebook since 2012, and we're making some corporate changes. Going forward, our terms will reflect that Facebook Inc. is responsible for Instagram. The Instagram app and the way we process data are not changing.\n\nOur Terms are now more clear about the service we provide, and what we expect from every member of our community to keep Instagram a safe place for everyone. Here are some updates we want to make sure you know about:\n\nWe updated our intellectual property licenses, but your rights aren't changing. You still own your photos and videos.\n\nWe updated how we use information to show activity on Instagram, so people can see when you've interacted with an ad the same way we do on a regular post.\n\nWe also have a new Data Policy that explains how data is collected, shared and used in the Facebook Products, including Instagram. The policy addresses newer features like stories, direct messaging, activity status and the creative tools in our cameras. We wanted to make sure you knew about this new information in the policy.\n\nWe receive different kinds of information from your device, like how you tap and scroll, which can help distinguish humans from bots and detect fraud.\n\nWe can use and share information for research, especially in ways that help us keep our community safe on Instagram, like to understand and prevent bullying and harassment.\n\nThe policy has more information about what we collect from your activity and our partners, how we connect information across the Facebook Companies and personalize your experience, including ads.\n\nWe provide ads without telling advertisers who you are. The policy has more information about what we do share with advertisers and partners. We never sell your data.\n\nBecause the policy also covers Facebook, it includes information about facial recognition. We don't use facial recognition technology on Instagram. If we introduce it, we'll let you know and give you a choice.\n\n \n\nAgree\n\n (https://www.instagram.com/accounts/row_tos_confirm/meva3k/FtHyf1MDns/)\n\n \n\n \n\nRead the Full Terms (https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870) and Data Policy (https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875)\n\n \n\n   \n\n© Instagram, 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025","priority":"normal","status":"solved","recipient":"support@aprtechsupport.zendesk.com","requester_id":789486279,"submitter_id":789486279,"assignee_id":360303091423,"organization_id":null,"group_id":21692179,"collaborator_ids":[619473389],"follower_ids":[619473389],"email_cc_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"is_public":true,"due_at":null,"tags":["email__spam_phishing","saratoga_office"],"custom_fields":[{"id":25468446,"value":"saratoga_office"},{"id":24173345,"value":false},{"id":23795495,"value":"33"},{"id":23427215,"value":"Anne"},{"id":23740819,"value":"363"},{"id":23427225,"value":"Cummins"},{"id":25285543,"value":null},{"id":25389783,"value":"email__spam_phishing"}],"satisfaction_rating":{"score":"unoffered"},"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":25468446,"value":"saratoga_office"},{"id":24173345,"value":false},{"id":23795495,"value":"33"},{"id":23427215,"value":"Anne"},{"id":23740819,"value":"363"},{"id":23427225,"value":"Cummins"},{"id":25285543,"value":null},{"id":25389783,"value":"email__spam_phishing"}],"followup_ids":[],"brand_id":77389,"allow_channelback":false},{"url":"https://aprtechsupport.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/69919.json","id":69919,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"email","source":{"from":{"address":"vincentc@apr.com","name":"Vincent Choi"},"to":{"name":"APR Support","address":"support@aprtechsupport.zendesk.com"},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2018-04-25T16:01:06Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T18:01:29Z","type":"question","subject":"Fwd: Fixer Upper for sale by REVestors: 230 Dale Dr, San Jose, CA 95127","raw_subject":"Fwd: Fixer Upper for sale by REVestors: 230 Dale Dr, San Jose, CA 95127","description":"Hello IT Friends,\r\n\r\nIs it possible to block this incoming gmail address in my APR email address?\r\nIf so, please show me how-to.\r\n\r\nThanks, in advances! :)\r\n\r\nKindest regards,\r\n Service of Distinction\r\nVincent Choi / Realtor / BRE 01171034\r\nAlain Pinel Realtors\r\n12772 Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road\r\nSaratoga, CA 95070\r\n7-Day 408-206-3466<tel:(408)%20206-3466>\r\nwww.vkchomes.com<http://www.vkchomes.com>\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY:  This email message, and any attachments thereto, is covered by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2510-2521, and may be privileged.

For some reason, we decided to sell it in the middle of rehab, take over the project and finish it. Huge corner lot. Permit applied and approved. New roof. All new material inside the house included. AS IS sale.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.revestorsllc.com/property/230-dale-dr-san-jose-ca-95127/<https://jakezhang-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1VYHXSdt3o7TIK4QvbiWqJxR0-K_AqRTa27F_UI27Rjw-0&key=YAMMID-32412172&link=http%3A%2F%2Frevestorsllcseller.oncarrot.com%2Fproperty%2F230-dale-dr-san-jose-ca-95127%2F>\r\n\r\nThe reason you receive this email is because we have identified you are an active and top performing agent in our local area. As an active real estate investment company, we want to explore the possibility of working with you to bring us your Pre-Listed or Off-Market Listings. If they are profitable deals, we will buy them for all cash and close in a few days. Plus after we rehab the houses, we will re-list them with you, so you are expecting to get a total of 2, 3 or even 4 commissions on only one deal.\r\n\r\nWhat is the potential income if you bring a good Pre-Listed or Off-Market Listings to us?\r\n\r\n$100k.\r\n\r\nYES! By bringing us a good Pre-Listed or Off-Market deal.\r\n\r\nREVestors LLC, also known as \"We Buy Your House in 7 Days\" company, is a local cash house buyer in San Jose, California. Since 2008, we have been buying, rehabbing and reselling  300+ houses for profits in local San Jose and its surrounding areas, and earned good reputation and trust in our local real estate community. We consistently work with top real estate agents like you to bring us motivated sellers that need to sell their houses fast with cash offer.\r\n\r\nCan it be real to make $100k commission from just ONE house??\r\n\r\nYES!\r\n\r\nExample 1: ML81683074 - 2285 Lenox Place, Santa Clara 95054\r\nThe agent brought us this off-market listing. She made $69k ($1,150,000 x 6%) commission when she brought the house to us, and another $39,875 ($1,595,000 x 2.5%) after we rehabbed the house and re-listed with her. She made a total $108,875 commission from this ONE house.\r\n\r\nExample 2: ML81685495 - 919 Almaden Avenue, Sunnyvale 94085\r\nThe agent brought us this off-market listing. She made $47,750 ($955,000 x 5%) commission when we bought the house, and another $38,637 ($1,405,000 x 2.75%) after we rehabbed the house and re-listed with her. She made a total $86,387 commission from this ONE house.\r\n\r\nDo you also want to make $100k commission from just ONE house?
