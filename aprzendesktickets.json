If the group belongs to a different organization than yours, contact the organization's customer service department for assistance. If the group is in your organization and you don't know who the group owner is, you can find it by doing the following in either Outlook on the web or Outlook:\n\n  *   Open your Sent folder, and then select the original message.\n  *   If you're using Outlook on the web, select the group name located on the To or CC line. If you're using Outlook, double-click the group name on the To or CC line.\n  *   In Outlook on the web, from the pop-up dialog box, choose Owner. In Outlook, choose Contact. The owner's name is listed under Owner.\n\n\nThe owner of the group may have intentionally chosen to restrict who can send messages to it, and they may not want to adjust the existing restriction. In this case, you'll have to contact the group members by some other means, such as sending an email message to their individual email addresses or contacting them by phone.\n\n\nWas this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525931>.\n________________________________\n\n\nMore Info for Email Admins\nStatus code: 550 5.7.124\n\nThis error occurs when the owner of the distribution group or security group has set up the group to accept messages only from certain addresses. Even a group owner may not be automatically granted permission to send messages to the group.\n\nTo fix this issue, the group owner must add the sender's address to the group's allowed senders list. Usually this issue can only be fixed by the group owner.\n\nFor more information and steps to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.7.124 in Office
