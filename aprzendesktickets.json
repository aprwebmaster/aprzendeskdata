As I have done for years, I opened the program, went to “Order History”, found my 2560 Carisbrook fold over with intention of changing the price and buying a new set.  However, instead of the “shopping cart” icon needed for reorder, which was still there for some of my other recent orders, there is an X.  I wrote to their Support line and this morning received the email I am forwarding.  I managed to do this process, but it is not intuitive, instead it is very obscure.  I’m writing to all because others may experience the wasted time and frustration I experienced.  There is no easy way to find these instructions in the Academy.
