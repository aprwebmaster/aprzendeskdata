house announcements for one of our agents…\r\nThe agent emailed me…but actually emailed me the wrong MLS#. As you know when you do the OH eblast, you enter  the number under the “Select A Property by Listing#” and it then auto populates the information into the flyer etc…\r\nWell today I just so happened to notice once I looked up the property ( as I always do to look at the pics to get an idea on how to describe it) it wasn’t even our listing. It was a listing by Sereno Group. What is scary is that I wanted to see if just by some chance I would have used that wrong MLS number (Sereno listing) what would have happened. It actually let me use it!!!! And it generated an APR OH eblast all set to go out to the 3,652 Real Estate agents in the Santa Clara county! I just wanted to bring this to marketing’s attention because if any agent decides to do this on their own it’s something that could be a big mistake!\r\nI am sure the Sereno agent would have received it and DEFINITLY gotten a little upset!\r\nI was under the impression that the SAVI CRM campaigns would only pull APR listings??\r\n\r\nDarci Marandon\r\nASSISTANT TO DAVE WALSH\r\nAlain Pinel

The subject line reads \"INFORMATION TO ALL ACTIVE MEMBERS\" and is from the email address mail@car.org. The email requests recipients to follow a link and sign in with their email to view information from C.A.R. to all active members. It also reads, \"This announcement has been uploaded for your kind information through our secure information sharing portal which is linked to your email server. Contact us for more details. Regards, CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS.\"\n\nThis email is not from C.A.R. and recipients of this email address should not open it or click on any links. If you've received this email, please delete it from your inbox immediately. It is a phishing email and your information is at risk.\n\nAs a reminder, phishing scams are on the rise. To avoid being scammed by phishing schemes, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers these tips:\nNever e-mail your financial information. Email is not considered secure.\nCheck the security of the website. For any financial information you provide over the web, check that the site is secure. The URL should being with https.\nBe careful what you click on. Don't click a link in an email to an organization's site. Instead, look up the real URL, and type it in yourself.\nBe cautious about opening attachments and downloading any files from e-mails.\nMake sure your operating system, browser, and security system are up-to-date.\n\nClick here for more info about phishing schemes<http://subscribe.car.org/e/85202/articles-0003-phishing/5fktgw/426716386>\n\nSincerely,\nStacey Castellano\nAssociation
